### Short description
It enables us to use the radio joining/switching/exiting from 1MHz to 100 MHz (1-10MHz its reserved for police, ambulance and fire) for officers and civilian. We can set in the `config.lua` what channels are to be restricted(default 1 - 10), and what should be opened to anyone who has the item `radio`

### Info
For working you must add item `radio` in your database
